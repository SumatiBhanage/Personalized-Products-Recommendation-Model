# Personalized-Products-Recommendation-Model

## Description
  This project builds a smart recommendation system for an e-commerce website. It uses data from user actions like what they view, add to their cart, and purchase to suggest products they might like.
  By analyzing user interactions, we create an interaction matrix and use a method called Alternating Least Squares (ALS)  which is an approach to Collaborative Filtering to recommend products that each user is most likely to be interested in, that is Personalized Product Suggestions.
